# Smile At Ur Phone

<img src="/static/og-image.png">

Smile At Ur Phone is a website I created to catalogue the various reasons people smile at their phone.

I came up with the idea when I walked past someone and saw them smiling down at their phone, and was curious what it could be, a picture of their dog, a message from a friend or something completely different.

The idea of the site is to allow people to submit their reason(s) to smile at their phone and to also be able to view other peoples reasons.
